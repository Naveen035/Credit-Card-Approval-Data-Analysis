Data Analysis
The data analysis process involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the distribution of individual features, relationships between them, and their impact on credit card approvals.
Visualizations
The project utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib to create various visualizations, including:

Histograms: To visualize the distribution of continuous variables.
Boxplots: To identify outliers and understand the spread of data.
Heatmaps: To show correlations between different features.
Pairplots: To explore relationships between multiple variables.
Insights
From the analysis, several key insights were derived:

Income and Age: Higher income and middle-aged applicants tend to have higher approval rates.
Employment Status: Applicants with stable employment have a better chance of approval.
Correlation Analysis: Certain features exhibit strong correlations with the approval status, which could be crucial in decision-making.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can be applied to understand the factors influencing credit card approvals. The insights gained can help in improving the approval process and identifying key characteristics of successful applicants.
